abstract = "Ticks act as vectors of a wide range of infectious agents, far encompassing any other group of bloodsucking arthropods worldwide. The prevention of tick-borne diseases is strictly linked to the successful management of tick vector populations. The employ of repellents can represent a worth solution to avoid tick bites. It is widely adopted to protect travellers and pets exposed to ticks during limited periods of the year. The use of natural products as active ingredients in eco-friendly repellent formulations is currently a prominent research area, due to the wide diversity and high effectiveness of a number of plant-borne compounds, with special reference to essential oils (EOs) extracted from medicinal and aromatic species. Here, we reviewed current knowledge available on EOs tested as repellents against tick species of veterinary importance. Furthermore, we analysed the effectiveness of pure compounds isolated from EOs as tick repellents and their potential implications for practical use in the öreal world”. A quantitative analysis of literature available is this research field was provided, along with its impact (i.e., in terms of citations over time) on the scientific community of researchers in tick control science and natural product chemistry. In the final sections, future outlooks are highlighted. We discussed major challenges to stabilize the most effective EOs and pure molecules, explore the synergistic and antagonistic effects in blends of EOs and/or pure constituents, standardize currently adopted testing methods, and evaluate non-target risks of herbal repellents."

abstract = {Abstract An evaluation of a new plant-based biting insect repellent (PMD) with the princial active ingredient p-menthane-3,8-diol is presented. Laboratory trials testing 50\% active ingredient formulations of the repellent on a human forearm show good repellency against the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae Giles s.s. with an average ED90 value of 0.68 μL/cm2 and effective protection from biting for around 5 h. These results compare favourably with a 20\% deet product, (ED90 value of 0.48 μL/cm2 with 5 h protection), and are far superior to the best known existing plant-based product, citronella (ED90 value of 1.37 μL/cm2 and 2 h protection). PMD was also found to give total protection against the biting midge, Culicoides variipennis Coquillett, for at least 6 h at 0.35 μL/cm2. When evaluated against the deer tick, Ixodes ricinis L., attachment and subsequent feeding of I. ricinis nymphs was significantly reduced on rabbit ears treated with 0.36 μL/cm2 of PMD. Against the stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans L, an application of 0.5 mL PMD to a human forearm reduced biting to 6\% of the control biting level. It is concluded that PMD is a broad spectrum repellent with considerable potential as means of personal protection against nuisance biting and insect-borne disease.},
