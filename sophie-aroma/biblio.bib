abstract = { AbstractThe oregano, Origanum onites L., essential oil (EO) was tested in laboratory behavioural bioassays for repellent activity against Amblyomma americanum (L.) and Aedes aegypti (L.). The O. onites EO was characterised using GC-FID and GC-MS. Carvacrol (75.70\%), linalool (9.0\%), p-cymene (4.33\%) and thymol (1.9\%) were the most abundant compounds. At a concentration of 0.413 mg oil/cm2 of filter paper, O. onites EO repelled 100\% of the ticks tested and at 0.103 mg oil/cm2 of filter paper, 66.7\% of the ticks were repelled. At 0.075 mg oil/cm2 filter paper, thymol repelled 66.7\% of the ticks compared to 28.7\% by carvacrol at that same concentration. Against Ae. aegypti, O. onites EO was repellent at the minimum effective dosage (MED) of 0.011 (±0.00) mg/cm2 in the cloth patch assay compared to the reference control, N,N-dimethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET) with a MED = 0.007 ± (0.003) mg/cm2. }

Concentration-repellency response was established using the vertical paper bioassay technique for each essential oil and compared with that of N,N-diethyl-3-methyl benzamide (DEET), a standard repellent compound present in many commercial repellent formulations. The effective concentration of DEET that repels 50 % of ticks (EC50) was estimated at 0.02 mg/cm(2), while EC50s of the essential oils fall between 0.113 and 0.297 mg/cm(2). Based on EC50 estimates, oregano essential oil was the most effective among all essential oils tested, followed by clove, thyme, vetiver, sandalwood, cinnamon, cedarwood, and peppermint oils. None of the tested essential oils demonstrated a level of tick repellency found with DEET. Results from this study illustrated the challenge in search for more effective natural tick repellents.}

abstract = {Abstract The control of Rhipicephalus microplus (Ixodida: Ixodidae) is achieved using synthetic acaricides. However, resistant tick populations are widespread around the world. Plant essential oils can act as repellents, keeping ticks away from hosts and decreasing the selection pressure on synthetic acaricides. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro repellent effect of Lippia alba essential oil on R. microplus larvae. Leaves from two L. alba genotypes maintained under the same agronomic and environmental conditions were collected. Essential oil was extracted by hydrodistillation and analysed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The major monoterpenes detected in the chemical analysis were commercially acquired and tested. For the repellency test, a glass rod was vertically fixed to measure active climbing of approximately 30 R. microplus larvae aged 14–21 days in response to essential oils and monoterpenes. Repellency was evaluated at 1 h, 3 h and 5 h after treatment. Variation in repellent action was detected between the genotypes. The major monoterpenes identified in the essential oils (limonene and carvone) showed low repellent effects in comparison with intact essential oils. Thus, the present results showed that L. alba essential oil contains bioactive compounds with great repellent activity against ticks that varies according to the plant genotype.},

abstract = "Mosquito vector control is facing a number of important and timely challenges, mainly due to the rapid development of pesticide resistance and environmental concerns. In this scenario, screening of botanical resources for their mosquitocidal activity may offer effective and eco-friendly tools against Culicidae vectors. Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae) is a vector of lymphatic filariasis and of dangerous arboviral diseases, such as West Nile and St. Louis encephalitis. In this study, the chemical composition of five essential oils obtained from different plants, namely Pinus nigra J.F. Arnold var. italica (Pinaceae), Hyssopus officinalis L. subsp. aristatus (Lamiaceae), Satureja montana L. subsp. montana (Lamiaceae), Aloysia citriodora Palau (Verbenaceae) and Pelargonium graveolens L'Hér (Geraniaceae), was investigated by GC–MS analysis. Furthermore, it was evaluated their acute toxicity on larvae of C. quinquefasciatus. Then, the most effective oils were selected, in order to focus on the potential synergistic and antagonistic effects, testing them in binary mixtures on C. quinquefasciatus larvae. Results showed that the higher effectiveness was obtained by S. montana subsp. montana essential oil (LC50=25.6μL·L−1), followed by P. nigra var. italica (LC50=49.8μL·L−1) and A. citriodora (LC50=65.6μL·L−1), while the other essential oils showed LC50 values higher than 90μL·L−1. The larvicidal effectiveness can be enhanced by preparing simple binary mixtures of essential oils, such as S. montana+A. citriodora (ratio 1:1), which showed higher larvicidal toxicity (LC50=18.3μL·L−1). On the other hand, testing S. montana+P. nigra (1:1) an antagonistic effect was detected, leading to a LC50 (72.5μL·L−1) higher than the LC50 values calculated for the two oils tested separately. Overall, our results add useful knowledge to allow the employ of synergistic essential oil blends as effective, cheap and eco-friendly mosquito larvicides."

abstract = "The castor bean tick, Ixodes ricinus, is a species of medical and veterinary importance. The use of synthetic acaricides for tick control has led to development of resistance, residues in the environment and animal products, and public health concerns. In this regard, plant essential oils and their main constituents represent an appealing alternative strategy to combat ticks. The phenols thymol and carvacrol and the alcohol linalool are monoterpenoids occurring in essential oils of several aromatic and medicinal plants, such as thyme, oregano, savory, lavender and coriander. Recent studies have shown toxicity of these monoterpenoids against selected mosquito vectors and other arthropod pests. However, information on their bioactivity on I. ricinus is not available. On this basis, here we evaluated the ovicidal, larvicidal and repellency effects of these compounds against I. ricinus. Concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5% were sprayed on the egg masses, then hatching rates were noted. Larvicidal assays were conducted on unengorged larvae, following the larval packet technique. The repellency was determined by measuring the vertical migration behavior of ticks in laboratory conditions. Carvacrol and thymol at all concentrations tested led to a significant hatching decrease, showing an efficacy higher than permethrin, whereas linalool did not cause any significant effect. In the larvae treated with carvacrol and thymol (1, 2 and 5%), mortality rates reached 100% after 24h, showing a larvicidal efficacy higher than permethrin, whereas no effect was seen in the larval groups treated with linalool. Carvacrol and thymol at all concentrations tested showed >90% repellency on I. ricinus. Linalool was scarcely effective (50.24% repellency) only at the concentration of 5%. Overall, based on these results, the phenols carvacrol and thymol can be considered as candidate ingredients for the development of novel acaricidal formulations to control the populations of I. ricinus and the spread of related tick-borne diseases."

A dose of 8μl TTO was lethal for more than 70% of ticks when inhaled and this effect was enhanced when the dose was increased to 10μl (>80%). The effect was correlated with the duration of exposure of ticks to TTO, with a significant effect being observed after 90min exposure. The findings show that TTO has acaricidal properties and could be extremely useful in controlling ticks that are efficient vectors of pathogens."

This study aimed to compare the efficacy of N,N-diethyl- 3-methylbenzamide (DEET), a standard repellent, versus β-citronellol in a Petri dish bioassay. A semicircle of filter paper (31.8cm2) was treated with 87μl of one of four concentrations (0.200, 0.100, 0.050 and 0.025mg/cm2) of β-citronellol, DEET or solvent (ethanol). A head-to-head test was developed treating one side with increasing concentrations of β-citronellol as above mentioned, against the highest concentration of DEET. Besides that a blank assay was performed. Three males and three females were placed in the middle of the plate and their location was evaluated 5, 10 and 30min after the test was initiated. As a result, the time had no significant effect on repellency response of the ticks exposed to both compounds and their concentrations. The repellency response raised according with the increase of concentration. Additionally, our findings indicate that the tick A. sculptum was more sensitive to the compounds tested and β-citronellol showed a higher efficacy than DEET. In addition, β-citronellol could be formulated to protect humans and other animals from R. sanguineus s. l. and A. sculptum infestation, as well as the diseases transmitted by these species."

abstract = {Abstract An evaluation of a new plant-based biting insect repellent (PMD) with the princial active ingredient p-menthane-3,8-diol is presented. Laboratory trials testing 50\% active ingredient formulations of the repellent on a human forearm show good repellency against the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae Giles s.s. with an average ED90 value of 0.68 μL/cm2 and effective protection from biting for around 5 h. These results compare favourably with a 20\% deet product, (ED90 value of 0.48 μL/cm2 with 5 h protection), and are far superior to the best known existing plant-based product, citronella (ED90 value of 1.37 μL/cm2 and 2 h protection). PMD was also found to give total protection against the biting midge, Culicoides variipennis Coquillett, for at least 6 h at 0.35 μL/cm2. When evaluated against the deer tick, Ixodes ricinis L., attachment and subsequent feeding of I. ricinis nymphs was significantly reduced on rabbit ears treated with 0.36 \mu L/cm2 of PMD. Against the stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans L, an application of 0.5 mL PMD to a human forearm reduced biting to 6\% of the control biting level. It is concluded that PMD is a broad spectrum repellent with considerable potential as means of personal protection against nuisance biting and insect-borne disease.},
