* Directions

 The following questions are addressed in the paper 
 [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26675800/above_the_clouds.pdf][/Above the Clouds: A Berkeley View of Cloud Computing/]].
 
You are expected to find a support for your answers in this paper.

 However, you are encouraged to discuss and the enrich the answers
 with your own opinions, which will be largely taken into account in
 the evaluation.

 Notice that Questions 6. and 7. have a limited support from the article.

 You must hand-in your answers by sending a email to [[genaud@unistra.fr]]
 by friday may 3rd, 8:00. 
 

* Questions.

** Q1. Key Factors 
What are the key factors that enabled Cloud computing?

** Q2. What's make clouds different?
What elements differentiate clouds from other large-scale distributed systems 
(e.g Grids) regarding the resources provided ?

** Q3. Public and Private Clouds
What are the differences between public and private clouds? Are there intermediate form
of public and private clouds? If yes, tell what benefit would it provide to the client
using it?

** Q4. Private vs. Public cloud decision making
Give an example of a situation where it is preferable to run a private cloud than
using a public cloud.

** Q5. Provider Lock-in
What are the risks of moving elements of its IT infrastructure to a public cloud?

** Q6. Applications 
What type of applications are best leveraged using Cloud Computing?

** Q7. Programming Models
What kind of parallel processing fits well to the Map-Reduce paradigm?

** Q8. Cloud vs. Cluster
Would you support the claim that ''a public cloud is not well adapted
to high-performance applications'', i.e applications running simultaneously
many processes and threads over different hosts interconnected with a high
throughput network? (Examples of such applications are MPI programs).

** Q9. Exploitation Cost and Elasticity
Explain which is pricing model the most commonly in public clouds, and
how it relates to /elasticity/.

** Q10. Your Concern
Consider you run a fresh start-up and you are the developper of an
application, which is to have a large audience over the internet
(for insance a popular application pluged in Facebook). What would
be your major concern? What solutions would you consider to solve
this issue?
