== Presentation 

This is the simplest possible CORBA example.
We assume a mapping to Java JDK with 'idlj'.
There is no module here, thus idlj will output helper and stub classes to the same directory.
Subsequent examples will use a module, which result in putting files in a directory used as
a java package.

% idlj -fall Operation.idl

It will generate the following files, where x = Operation, because of the 'Operation' interface:

xHelper.java
xHolder.java
xOperations.java
xPOA.java

* Helper contains methods to :
- cast (which is said 'narrow' here) the CORBA remote object into the 
  appropriate mapped language type
- read/write functions used to communicate over the line
- insert/extract functions to be used when you use an 'Any' (generic object) container

* Holder contains methods to read values for out and inout parameters

* POA contains functions to manage the servant that supports the remote object execution.


== What needs to be done

The programmer duty is to write
- the Server which starts a POA in charge of serving the object implementation
- the object implementation (the functionnal part of the application)
- the Client which uses the remote Object
