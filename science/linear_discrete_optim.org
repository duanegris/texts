* Linear Programming
** Example: Production Plant Problem

2 drinks, Spring and Nebsi. Each contains two liquids, A and B.
For 100l of Spring and Nebsi, there is :

|        | A  | B  | profit |
|--------+----+----+--------|
| Spring | 3l | 8l | $100   |
| Nebsi  | 6l | 4l | $125   |

*Goal* : maximize the profit

Further constraint: 
- 30l of A in stock
- 44l of B in stock
- barel capacity able to store Spring : 500l
- barel capacity able to store Nebsi  : 400l

*Production plan*: find a vector (x_1,x_2) \in R^2

Max 100*x1 + 125*x2 s.t.
(x1 <= 400)
(x2 <= 500)
x1>=0
x2>=0
3*x1 + 6*x2 <= 30
8*x1 + 4*x2 <= 44 
   
Graphical resolution :
- define the area under constraint
- find the intersection point between the line 100*x1+125*x2 and the area

Answer here : x1=4 x2=3  (400l and 300l)


** Proving Optimality

Point (4,3) is suspected to be the optimal solution.
It is the intersection of the two equations
- 3*x1 + 6*x2 <= 30  (a)
- 8*x1 + 4*x2 <= 44  (b)
These equations are special because (4,3) satisfies them with equality.
Let multiply (a) by 50/3, (b) by 25/4
- 50*x1 + 100*x2 <= 500  (a)
- 50*x1 + 25*x2  <= 275  (b)

Each feasible production plan satisfies each of these ineq., and 
Each feasible production plan satisfies the addition of these ineq., i.e
100*x1 + 125*x2 <= 775

The first part of the ineq is the profit.
We have therefore shown that any feasible plan has a profit of at most 775.
And the profit of (4,3) is 775.
Hence (4,3) is optimal.

** Definition of LP
*** Definition
A linear program consits of a linear objective function
c_1*x_1 + ... + c_n*x_n
and linear inequalities
a_11*x_1 + ... + a_1n*x_n <= b_1
...
a_m1*x_1 + ... + a_mn*x_n <= b_m

Find x_1, ..., x_n of maximum objective function value
satisfying the linear inequalities.

**** greater or equal instead?
Think of multipliying by -1 if inequality in the other direction 

*** Matrix Notation

$max { C^T \dot X : x \in \R, A x \leq b}

$A \in \R^{m n}$
 
*** Def of feasible solution, optimal, bounded

- A point x \in \R^n is caled feasible if x satisfies all linear constraints.

- A feasible solution x is optimal if C^T * x >= C^T * y for all feasible solutions y.

- A LP is bounded if there exists a constant M \in \R s.t. C^T * x <= M holds forall feasible x \in \R^n
 
   
** Linear algebra vs Linear programming

- solving a linear system A x = b
  Gaussian algorithm
