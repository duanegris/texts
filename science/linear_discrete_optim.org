** Example: Production Plant Problem

2 drinks, Spring and Nebsi. Each contains two liquids, A and B.
For 100l of Spring and Nebsi, there is :

|        | A  | B  | profit |
|--------+----+----+--------|
| Spring | 3l | 8l | $100   |
| Nebsi  | 6l | 4l | $125   |

*Goal* : maximize the profit

Further constraint: 
- 30l of A in stock
- 44l of B in stock
- barel capacity able to store Spring : 500l
- barel capacity able to store Nebsi  : 400l
