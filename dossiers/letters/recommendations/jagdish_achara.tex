\begin{letter}[Recommendation of Jagdish Achara for a PhD position]{to}{INRIA}

Dear Madam/Sir, 

I have worked with Jagdish from april 2009 to august 2009, as he was
starting an internship with me in the AlGorille EPI, before finishing 
his bachelor in India. It seems he has enjoyed his stay in France since 
he has renewed a similar training course the year after, in another EPI (CASSIS) in Nancy. 

I can say from this early training course that Jagdish is a
hard-working person. He is also faithful. He promised me to finish an anedoctic
part of the work after he has gone back to India and actually did it. I
feel he has strong commitments in the assigned work objectives.

I think Jagdish is also curious and has the potential to learn much. I
cannot reply precisely regarding his skills in machine learning and
profiling techniques. I know he has worked to parallelize a software
use to label genes (biology), based on Conditional Random Fields
http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/conrad/
Jagdish use P2P-MPI for the parallelization but i am not sure of the
level of expertise he acquired with the applicative method itself.


Since this first time we worked together, Jagdish has kept me regularly 
updated about his curriculum and i have been pleased to hear that he was
hired on a engineer position at INRIA in Grenoble. This also means he has 
learn a lot since i have met him, and therefore my opinion on his technical
skills is hardly relevant. As a baseline, I highly recommend Jagdish for 
his human qualities and his strong committment in work, which i believe
are strong assets for this PhD position.
