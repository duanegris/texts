\begin{letter}[Recommandation of Anaïs Monet for an internship]
  {To}{Admission Chair, Computational Biology Group, Barcelona Supercomputing Center}

  Dear Sir/Madam,

  i am writing upon request from Anaïs  Monet to recommend her for an internship
  in  the Computational  Biology  of BSC.  Her attention  was  attracted by  the
  opportunity as advertized on your web site%
  \footnote{https://www.bsc.es/join-us/excellence-career-opportunities/bsc-international-summer-hpc-internship-programme
  }.

  Anaïs is  a student in  computer science  at our institution  Telecom Physique
  Strasbourg,  an  engineering school  part  of  University of  Strasbourg.  The
  curriculum in  computer science  Anaïs is currently  following starts  after a
  first  curriculum  called  \emph{Classes  préparatoires}  whose  subjects  are
  strongly focused on mathematics and physics. Entering our engineering school
  involves a highly selective process.


  I know Anaïs since the begining of this academic year 2018-2019 and had her as
  a student  in two  courses :  i) Introduction to  Operating Systems,  in which
  shell  programming  represents  the  most  part  of  hands-on  work,  and  ii)
  Object-Oriented  Programming,  with  C++  and Java  as  supporting  languages.
  Although the  courses are  still on going,  intermediary assesments  show that
  Anaïs has a good grasp  in both subjects.
%
  The internship programmed in the curriculum is a short one for the 1st year
  (4 weeks at least), however i think Anaïs is sufficiently autonomous to solve
  some time-limited tasks. 

  Having  speaked with  her of  her  motivations for  the Computational  Biology
  Group, i am convinced this is by  far her first choice. She has recently taken
  part      to       a      \emph{hackathon}      dedicated       to      health
  \footnote{http://hackinghealth.camp}, which reinforced her motivation%
  \footnote{http://www.telecom-physique.fr/actualites/actualite/news/11-eleves-ingenieurs-mobilises-pour-le-hacking-health-camp-2019/}. I
  can  witness Anaïs  is  a hard-working  and enthusiastic  person,  and a  good
  team-worker.

 For these reasons, i highly recommend Anaïs for her candidacy to an internship 
 in the Computational Biology Group.

 Yours Sincerley,
