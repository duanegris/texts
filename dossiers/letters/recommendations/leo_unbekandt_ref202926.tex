\begin{letter}[Recommendation of Léo Unbekandt]{to}{University of Cranfield\\Your reference number 202926}

Dear Madam/Sir, 

I know Léo since he has been admitted at the ENSIIE Engineering School in september 2011.
I was first appointed as an associate professor at ENSIIE, on the leave from University of Strasbourg.
As an associate professor, i am teaching a set of courses in computer science at ENSIIE's students.

I had Léo as a student in three courses: "Operating Systems", "Network Programming" and "Middleware"
in his first 3 semesters of study (out of six). In all these courses, Léo ranked first out of the
18 students of his class. Léo is likely to rank in the top 10\% among all students (Evry and Strasbourg
campuses, which is about 170 students of the same year).

As a researcher, i have also hired Léo for a short internship (10 weeks) last summer. I have been
impressed by the autonomy of Léo during this work. He has shown to be plenty of initiatives,
trying an impressive number of ideas before reporting to me what were the tracks explored,
and their pros and cons. As a team member, he was also very friendly and eager to 
collaborate with the rest of the team. Léo has done a marvellous work in this short
training period.

As a baseline, I can say Léo is one of the best students i have had the chance to 
supervise and therefore i strongly recommend him for a MSc course at Cranfield university.
