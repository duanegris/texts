\begin{letter}[Recommendation of Félix Kelinpeter]{to}{Beijing University of
    Posts and Telecommunications}

Dear Colleague, 

I know Félix Kleinpeter since she has been admitted at the ENSIIE Engineering
School in september  2015.  I am also a  teacher and i had the  pleasure to have
Félix  as  a   student  in  three  courses:   "Operating  Systems",  "Network
Programming" and "Advanced  Programming" in his first 3 semesters  of study (out
of  six). In  all  my  classes, Felix  has  performed  very well.  More
generally, his academic  results are very good. His average  overall subjects is
in the top 25\% of his batch for this semester.

I can also witness that Félix is  a reliable, committed, and hard-working student.
He is always attentive to remarks and suggestions, has good inter-personal
skills, which allowed him to produce nice team work in the various projects
that are part of the curriculum.

He is also interested in other cultures and his desire to  study in China as part 
of his curriculum demonstrates this aspect of his character.

Given my discussions  with my colleague Pierre Dossantos  Uzzaralde, director of
the ENSIIE's International  Relationships Department, who has  a broad knowledge
of our partners  expectations, i think Sophie  is a very good  candidate to take
part into a curricumum at BUPT and i therefore highly recommend her application.
