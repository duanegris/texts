\begin{letter}[Recommendation of Stéphane Kastenbaum]{to}{Beijing University of
    Posts and Telecommunications}

Dear Colleague, 

I know Stephane Kastenbaum since she has been admitted at the ENSIIE Engineering
School in september  2015.  I am also a  teacher and i had the  pleasure to have
Stéphane  as  a   student  in  three  courses:   "Operating  Systems",  "Network
Programming" and "Advanced  Programming" in his first 3 semesters  of study (out
of  six). In  all  my  classes, Stephane  has  performed  remarkably well.  More
generally, his academic  results are very good. His average  overall subjects is
in the top 20\% of the batch for this semester.

I can also witness that Stéphane is  a very curious and enthusiastic person. His
interests lie  in many scientific subjects.  For instance, he chose  as elective
subject this semester a course on Quantum Cryptography.

He is also interested in other cultures and his will to  study in China as part 
of his curriculum demonstrates this aspect of his character.

Given my discussions  with my colleague Pierre Dossantos  Uzzaralde, director of
the ENSIIE's International  Relationships Department, who has  a broad knowledge
of our partners  expectations, i think Stéphane is a very good  candidate to take
part into a curricumum at BUPT and i therefore highly recommend her application.
