\begin{letter}[Recommendation of Gabriel Metzger for the MPALG curriculum]{to}{Chalmers University}

Dear Madam/Sir, 

I know Gabriel since he has been admitted at the ENSIIE Engineering School in september 2013.
%
I had Gabriel as a student in three courses: "Operating Systems",
 "Network Programming" and "Middleware" in his first 3 semesters 
of study (out of six). In all these courses, Gabriel ranked in the top 
5\% first out of the  39 students of his class.  Gabriel is likely to 
rank in the top 10\%  among all students (Evry and Strasbourg
campuses, which is about 170 students in the same year). 

Therefore, I recommend Gabriel to the highest point for the graduate 
course (\textit{MPALG}: Computer Science, specialized in Algorithms, Languages and Logic) 
he is applying for. He is both a hard-working and brillant student, with a 
sharp analytical mind. 

Besides his intellectual capabilities, Gabriel is also a
 very nice and  open-minded person, always curious of new ideas. 
As director  of the Strasbourg campus of ENSIIE, i have also observed that Gabriel
was eager to participate in many of the initiatives the students are encouraged
to take. Gabriel took part last year to at least two public coding contests, and 
has helped all along the year in a club whose role is to develop distributed
services to help students in their software project (e.g providing extensions to
leverage the usage of source control management tools).

As a baseline, i consider that Gabriel has a very wide academic background,
from the intensive maths and physics curriculum he followed in his first two
academic years before being admitted to the school (\emph{classes
  pr√©paratoires}), to the computer science curriculum followed these last
two years at ENSIIE. All along his studies, Gabriel proved to be an excellent 
student, and i strongly  recommend his application.
