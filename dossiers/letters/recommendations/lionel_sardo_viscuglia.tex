\begin{letter}[Recommendation of Xavier Cavarelli]{to}{Dean of the Graduate School of Engineering\\%
Tohoku University}

Dear Colleague, 

I know Xavier since he has been admitted at the ENSIIE Engineering School in september 2011.
I am also a teacher and i had the pleasure to have Xavier as a student in three courses: 
"Operating Systems", "Network Programming" and "Middleware" in his first 3 semesters of 
study (out of six). In all these courses, Xavier ranked in the top most part of his class.
The overall academic records of Xavier are excellent, with a strong background in science,
especially maths and physics.


As a dean, i have regular meetings with Xavier to arrange many details of the students 
activities as he took quite a number of responsabilities on behalf of the other students.
Xavier has proved to be plenty of iniatives, for instance to facilitate the relationships
between the school and the industry. I can also witness that Xavier is an excellent team worker
through the projects i reviewed, which Xavier was involved in. The latest example was 
a project using open data, which is most likely to be very succesful.


Xavier is overall a faithful and friendly person, very open-minded to foreign cultural 
environments. He has proven his curiosity though his first summer internship in Japan last
year. In my opinion, this makes him an ideal candidate for team work at your institution.


As a baseline, I can say Xavier is a very good student, skillful in computer science,
and i therefore highly recommend  him for an internship in computer vision in the Aerospace 
Engineering Department.
