\begin{letter}[Recommendation of Carole Bocquillon]{to}{Science Connect,
    European Science Foundation}

\vspace{-2cm}
Dear Sir/Madam,

It is my pleasure to recommend Carole Bocquillon for the open position of
Administrative Assistant at Science Connect.

I know Carole since september 2013, when I hired her as administrative assistant
at ENSIIE. ENSIIE is a public engineering  school in Computer Science, and had a
campus in Strasbourg until last summer.  I was heading this campus in Strasbourg
and i was relying  on a couple of administrative assistants  to handle the daily
duties for about  120 students. Given the limited staff,  we were expecting each
staff member  to be very  versatile. In this regard,  Carole has been  the right
person.

Altough  her previous  experience  did  not involve  human  management, she  got
rapidly acquainted with  the tasks she were assigned, which  involved many human
exchanges with students or professors and  researchers. For instance, one of her
mission was  to teach  the students  how to use  the various  information system
interfaces available through the intranet.  Despite her young age, Carole showed
she could master the audience even in front of 120 students.
 
As ENSIIE was  co-located with ISU (International Space  university) in Illkirh,
Carole also had to collaborate with the english-speaking team of ISU, especially
when joint events were organized between  ENSIIE and ISU.  Carole is open-minded
and generally very  interested in other cultures, and therefore  i have not been
surprised that she  did very well when looking after  the international teams of
students that compete in these events.  During her period at ENSIIE, Carole also
chose  to strengthen  her foreign  language skills  by taking  language courses
taught at  the school. For  instance, she passed the  TOEIC english test  with a
score of 990.\\[-5mm]

All along her mission at ENSIIE, Carole has shown to be a faithful person, very
involved in her job. I can witness that Carole is a good team-worker and willing
to achieve the mission she has been assigned.

As a bottom line, I am convinced Carole has a great willingness to discover new
work environments, especially those involving intercultural aspects such those
i imagine are involved at Science Connect. Therefore, i highly recommend the
application of Carole Bocquillon for this position.
