\begin{letter}[Recommendation of Thomas Mazurkiewicz for the \emph{Complex Adaptative System} Master curriculum]{to}{Chalmers University}

Dear Madam/Sir, 

I know Thomas since he has been admitted at the ENSIIE Engineering School in september 2013.
%
I had Thomas as a student in three courses: "Operating Systems",
 "Network Programming" and "Middleware" in his first 3 semesters 
of study (out of six). In all these courses, Thomas ranked in the top 
5\% first out of the  39 students of his class.  Thomas is likely to 
rank in the top 10\%  among all students (Evry and Strasbourg
campuses, which is about 170 students in the same year). 

Therefore, I recommend Thomas to the highest point for the graduate 
course \textit{Complex Adaptative System} he is applying for. 
All along the two years Thomas has spent so far at ENSIIE, he has shown
to be a very quick-learner and also a hard-working student.

Besides his intellectual capabilities, Thomas is also a
 very nice person. The training course (10 weeks) he took this summer in
a research team of biologists was very successful and his supervisors underlined
the curiosity and ability of Thomas to communicate with people from other disciplines.
As director  of the Strasbourg campus of ENSIIE, i have also observed that Thomas
was eager to participate in many of the initiatives the students are encouraged
to take. Thomas took part last year to at least two public coding contests.

As a baseline, i consider that Thomas has a very wide academic background,
from the intensive maths and physics curriculum he followed in his first two
academic years before being admitted to the school (\emph{classes
  pr√©paratoires}), to the computer science curriculum followed these last
two years at ENSIIE. All along his studies, Thomas proved to be an excellent 
student, and i strongly recommend his application.
