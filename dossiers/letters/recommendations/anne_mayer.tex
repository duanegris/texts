\begin{letter}[Recommendation of Anne Mayer]{to}{Dean of the UnderGraduate School of Engineering\\%
Tohoku University}

Dear Colleague, 

I know Anne since she has been admitted at the ENSIIE Engineering School in september 2012.
I am also a teacher and i had the pleasure to have Anne as a student in three courses: 
"Operating Systems", "Network Programming" and "Middleware" in her first 3 semesters of 
study (out of six). I can witness that Anne is an extremely motivated student who has
a constant attentive listening.

She has obtained very good academic results in her first year, ranking in the top most 35\%
of her class for technical subjects (Computer Science and Maths).
The overall academic records of Anne are excellent, with a strong background in science,
especially maths and physics.

I have discussed with Anne of the courses she wishes to take at your institution
and i totally agree with her choices. There is a good balance between subjects for which
she is new to (e.g Mechatronics, Robotics Project) and subjects for which she is
partly knowledgeable (e.g Computer Software Engineering, Numerical Analysis).


As a dean, i have regular contacts with students in order to discuss many of the details
that make their life at ENSIIE and i can tell that Anne is a very positive person,
who has proved to be plenty of iniatives.
Anne is overall a faithful and friendly person, very open-minded to foreign cultural 
environments. Her will to go to Japan is in my opinion a strong commitment in that 
regard. In my opinion, this makes her an excellent candidate for studying at your 
institution.


As a baseline, I can say Anne is a very good student, skillful in computer science,
and i therefore highly recommend her for the exchange program with Tohoku University.
