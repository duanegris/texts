Dear Madam/Sir, 

I know Philippe since  he has been admitted at the  ENSIIE Engineering School in
september 2012.   As a  professor, i am  teaching a set  of courses  in computer
science at ENSIIE's students.

I had  Philippe as  a student  in three  courses: "Operating  Systems", "Network
Programming"  and  "Middleware" in  his  first  3  semesters  of study  (out  of
six). These courses  require from the students with a  more theoretical academic
background, to acquire quickly a large body of technical kwonledge. This was the
case  for  Philippe whose  background  before  entering  the school  was  mostly
mathematics  and physics  (\textit{classes  préparatoires}).  In  spite of  this
novelty,  Philippe  has  progressed  a  lot  in  these  subjects  in  his  first
year. During the  fall semester, he got 13/20 in  the Operating Systems subject,
and  then  during  Spring  semester  got the  maximum  grade  20/20  in  Network
Programming. His group had  29 students and i reckon Philippe  ranked in the top
20\%  of the  group in  this field.   In his  second year,  he finally  chose an
assement related to  Network security and was not evaluated  by me. Nonetheless,
he showed a constant interest in my lectures regarding middleware.  Philippe has
shown to be a very motivated and curious student in all my courses.

It comes in fact as no surprise  as Philippe succeeded (with another student) to
Léo  Unbekandt --  a student  currently studying  in the  Master of  Distributed
Computing \& e-Science at Cranfield --, in the student association whose goal is
to offer  network and distributed  services to other  students. This is  a heavy
responsability since  most students rely  for their programming  assignments, on
the  source code  management  system and  storage space  hosted  at the  servers
maintained by the association. I know Philippe  and his team mate have done very
well in this task, offering a  (cloud-like) automatic deployment service for web
applications developped by students.

As a baseline, I can say Philippe  is a very enthusiastic student, with a strong
scientific academic background. I am confident that he will perform very well in
a Master  such as the Master  of Distributed Computing since  his motivation for
this subject is  undoubtly very high.  I therefore strongly  recommend him for a
MSc curriculum at Cranfield university.
