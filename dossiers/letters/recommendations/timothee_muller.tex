\begin{letter}[Recommendation of Timothée \textsc{Muller}]{to}{Whom might be concerned}

Dear sir/Madam, 

I know Timothée since  he has been admitted at the  ENSIIE Engineering School in
september 2011.  I am also a lecturer  and I had the pleasure to haveTimothée as
a  student in  three  courses: "Operating  Systems",  "Network Programming"  and
"Middleware"  in his  first  3 semesters  of study  (out  of six)%
\footnote{The
  curriculum at ENSIIE starts two years after Baccalauréat and finishes with the
  delivery of a  postgraduate diploma (diplôme d'Ingénieur,  considered a Master
  grade).}.  In all  these courses, Timothee ranked  in the top most  part of his
class. The  overall academic records  of Timothée  are excellent, with  a strong
background in science, especially in maths and physics.


Timothée has made  the courageaous decision at the begining  of his second year,
to register  for a  double-curriculum.  Simultaneously  to his  Computer Science
curriculum,  he  has  been  admitted   in  the  highly  selective  \emph{Diplôme
  Universitaire d'Actuariat de Strasbourg} (DUAS),  handled by the department of
Mathematics at the University of Strasbourg.   The two curriculae have in common
some subjects in  mathematics, especially in statistics  and probability.  Given
the stronger  requirements in the DUAS  diploma, Timothee validated some  of the
courses  for  both   diplomas.   Nonetheless,  he  has   shown  impressive  work
capabilities to  brilliantly manage these  two curriculae. He got  awarded these
two very selective diplomas last autumn, and the obtention of the DUAS makes him
enter the french prestigious \emph{Institut des Actuaires}.


As a baseline, I can say Timothée  is both a hard-working and brilliant student,
with  excellent  academic   records  in  the  field  of   computer  science  and
mathematics. He  is also a  very pleasant and amenable  person, with whom  it is
very easy to work. He is very efficient  and rigorous in his work. Overall, i am
convinced that  Timothée has  all the  technical and human  skills to  conduct a
brilliant professional career, and i  can therefore recommend his application to
the highest point.
