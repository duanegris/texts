\begin{letter}[Recommendation of Aurélie Pallas for the \emph{Traffic Measurement and Data Analysis}i internship]{to}{IIJ Innovation Institute's Research Laboratory} 

Dear Madam/Sir, 

I know Aurélie since she has been admitted at the ENSIIE Engineering School in september 2013.
%
I had Aurélie  as a student in three courses: "Operating Systems",
 "Network Programming" and "Middleware" in his first 3 semesters 
of study (out of six). In all these courses, Aurélie proved to be a
very reliable and hard-working student. 

As i understand the internship proposal \emph{Traffic Measurement and Data Analysis} for
the  development of algorithms to provide compact summary information of large-scale traffic data,
i feel Aurélie has a very appropriate academic background to achieve 
the tasks you could assign to her. Altough she did not have a specialized curriculum
in advanced networking (but computer networks is part of her curriculum), she has  
a strong scientific background related to statistics and data mining.

Besides her intellectual capabilities, Aurélie is also a very nice person. 
She has shown a great curiosity and i am sure she has the ability to interact 
with scientists to address the issues that could be proposed to her.
As director  of the Strasbourg campus of ENSIIE, i have also observed that Aurélie
was eager to participate in many of the initiatives the students are encouraged
to take. Aurélies took part last year to at least two public coding contests.

As a baseline, i consider that Aurélie  has a very wide academic background,
from the intensive maths and physics curriculum he followed in his first two
academic years before being admitted to the school (\emph{classes
  préparatoires}), to the computer science curriculum followed these last
two years at ENSIIE. All along his studies, Aurélie proved to be an excellent 
student, and i strongly recommend his application for this internship.
