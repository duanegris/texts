\begin{letter}[Recommendation of Sophie Ly]{to}{Beijing University of
    Posts and Telecommunications}

Dear Colleague, 

I know Sophie Ly since she has been admitted at the ENSIIE Engineering School in
september 2015.  I am also a teacher and  i had the pleasure to have Sophie as a
student  in  three  courses:  "Operating  Systems",  "Network  Programming"  and
"Advanced Programming" in his first 3 semesters of study (out of six). In all my
classes, Sophie  has been a very  attentive and committed student  and performed
very well.  More generally, her academic  records are very good during her first
three semesters.

I can also witness that Sophie Ly has very good inter-personnal skills, which
allowed her to achieve excellent team work. She showed to be very efficient,
going straight-forward to the objective, and dedicated to the team's results.

Her will to  study in China as  part of her curriculum demonstrates her desire to
discover new cultural environments, which is coherent with her open mindness.

Given my discussions with my colleague Pierre Dossantos Uzzaralde, director of
the ENSIIE's International Relationships Department, who has a broad knowledge
of our partners expectations, i think Sophie is a very good candidate to take
part into a curricumum at BUPT and i therefore highly recommend her application.
