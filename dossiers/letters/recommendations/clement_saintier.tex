\begin{letter}[Recommendation of Clément Saintier]{to}{Beijing University of
    Posts and Telecommunications}

Dear Colleague, 

I know  Clément Saintier since  he has been  admitted at the  ENSIIE Engineering
School in september  2015.  I am also a  teacher and i had the  pleasure to have
Clément  as   a  student  in   three  courses:  "Operating   Systems",  "Network
Programming" and "Advanced  Programming" in his first 3 semesters  of study (out
of six). In all these courses, Clément ranked in the top most part of his class.
The overall academic records of Clément  are excellent, with a strong background
in science, especially maths and physics.


I can  witness that Clément is  an excellent team-worker through  the projects i
reviewed. He is  also a very open-minded person and  curious and towards foreign
cultural environments.  His will to  study abroad as  part of his  curriculum is
therefore very logical to me.


Given my discussions with my colleague Pierre Dossantos Uzzaralde, director of
the ENSIIE's International Relationships Department, who has a broad knowledge
of our partners expectations, i think Clément is a very good candidate to take
part into a curricumum at BUPT and i therefore highly recommend his application.
