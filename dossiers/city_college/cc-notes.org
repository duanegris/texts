|--------------------------------+---------------------------|
| MSc in Software Development    | €6,800 (full fees, FT/PT) |


** Accreditation

- The  Bachelor's  programmes of  the  Computer  Science Department  were  first
  accredited by  the British Computer  Society (BCS)  during its first  visit to
  CITY  College on  16th  of  April 2004  and  have  been re-accredited  (5-year
  unconditional accreditation) ever  since, with the last audit  taking place in
  October 2019.

- UK  NARIC,  the ‘National  Academic  Recognition  Information Centre’  is  the
  official national  agency in UK  which is  responsible for the  recognition of
  academic  and professional  rights and  privileges of  degree holders  from UK
  Universities.

* Curriculum BSc

** First Q/A
- With just 2 maths courses (discrete m. + continuous m.) the BSc CS is closer to an /IUT/ than a /Licence/ in France.
- Possible to teach more  theoretical courses ? 
  +  A: -  Yes,  many of  our  permanent  teachers have  the  background and  If
    necessary, we can employ more staff for this purpose.

- No internship in the curriculum. 
  + A: we have introduced industry  placements in our Master courses as optional
    to the students.  Worth 0 ECTS. We plan to change and give credits.

- Adding internships requires workforce + industrial relationships



** BSc
- How similar/different are the curricula? 
- 2 credits = 1 ECTS

- Year 1

* Exchanges
  
- How should student exchanges organized?

* Academic Staff

- *Fact* : 12 permanents FT teachers (CS departement)
- Q: How many staff ? FT/PT   Q: Which amount of teaching hours covered by FT w.r.t PT staff ?
- A: Clear process of recruitement, based on the University of Sheffield Academic Career Pathway
  + Academics full-time : The administration boards receives the application (cover letter + CV) 
  + Part-Time staff are employed by the College on contractual arrangements that
    are  made on  the  basis of  their  teaching hours  (normally  less than  10
    weekly).

Dear Stephane, I hope my email finds you well.

Apologies for delaying a week to reply, but I was abroad for a project kick off meeting. This email attempts  to answer your questions. I hope we provide with enough information to proceed with new meetings. I any case, however, you can request further clarifications and I will respond as quickly as possible. 

** Q1: on your side, did you review Unistra's tracks in computer science?

** A1: 
Yes, we have a look but not thoroughly reviewed. Obviously there are differences in the curricula, something which is expected between Universities. Our aim was to send you the current curricula for you to review. In case the collaboration goes ahead and as we stated during our meeting, we are willing to review our programmes in order to meet any requirements for adjustments you might have.

** Q2: in comparison to what we do, your lessons seem to have less practical work (in lab) : what are your resources in terms of rooms with computers, servers, network devices, etc?

** A2: 
The practical work in our programme are as follows:
- Year 1: 48% lab work (of total teaching hours)
- Year 2: 49% lab work
- Year 3: 52% lab work
- Across the whole programme: Average of 50% lab work
In addition, an average of 42% of assessment is through coursework and practical work, 47% through examinations and 11% through the individual final year project. 

With regards to resources (rooms with computers/labs, servers, network devices, etc) please see the attached file.

** Q3: your bachelor currently follows the Sheffield model, with many optional courses during the 2nd and 3rd years. Do each of theses courses open each year or semester, or some are closed because students do not choose them?

** A3: 
Indeed, we follow the University model and provide a number of options for student to choose from. Few of them do not run every year; the reason is either that the students do not choose them or very few student choose these courses thus the number does not exceed the quota we set (minimum number of students in a class), something that the students know in advance. 

** Q4:  in addition, you said that your staff (in the CS department) includes 12 full-time teachers ; so we presume that you also employ external people to ensure all of your courses/lectures; Who are these people? How do you hire them (what diplomas, personal/professional skills, etc.)?

** A4: 
We employ some additional academic staff on a Part-Time contract to cover the delivery of specialised courses. These are colleagues who are currently employed in the industry but have specialised knowledge and competence. The criteria for recruitment are the same as in FT staff, i.e. they should have the appropriate relevant academic qualifications and professional skills. Newly appointed PT staff goes through training and normally, they stay with us many consecutive years.

For more details on recruitment of PT staff, please see the attached document.

** Q5: do you have staff who can teach mathematics or theoretical computer science in a larger proportion?

** A5: 
Of course! Many of our staff have a strong background in Mathematics, Formal Methods, Computational Theory etc. and if needed they can teach additional theoretical computer science courses. If necessary, we can employ more staff for this purpose.

** Q6: in your current masters, internships seems to be optional (according to the tracks) : some do include industry placement, and some do not. And it is not clear if these interships are valued with european credits. In France , it is mandatory to include an internship (~5-6 months, either in industry or in a research laboratory) during the last semester of the master. That requires strong relations and partnerships with local industry : what are your actions in this direction ? could you tell us about your relationship with companies?

** A6: 
Firstly, we have introduced industry placements in our Master courses as optional to the students. Those who take it, they will be awarded a degree in which Industry Placement is explicitly stated. However, the placement does not bare any credits until now but aims to develop their employabiliy profile. As mentioned above, we are willing to discuss any changes you suggest and have credits associated with the industry placement.

Secondly, you are right in saying that such an approach would require strong relations and partnerships with local industry. We believe that we have built strong strategic partnerships with industry through our long lasting relationships. Please have a look at the attached file to find more about this.

** Q7: all masters in France have to be linked to one or more research teams, and must include research components (initiation to research, participation of students in research projects, etc.) ; it seems that this is not your case now? how do you think your research lab could support all these activities ?

** A7 : 
In the UK system, having labs/research teams is not mandatory as long as there exists academic staff with related competence. In our Department, academic staff have research and expertise in the areas in which Master programmes are provided. Since the number is relatively small (but more than adequate to serve the number of students we have in the Department, staff/student ratio is approximately 1/10), we organise ourselves through teams that work in the same area of research. Students are exposed to research through:
- research-led teaching and learning
- a research methods course mandatory for all Masters students
- research conducted through their dissertation project which amounts to 1/3 of the programme credits.


** Q8: about research in City College : on your website some links are broken so that it is difficult to gather informations, in particular your publications. Do you have an activity report that you could send us, and which would bring together  and synthesize the important elements of the research area ?

** A8: 
You are right, we noticed that the web link is broken because of a database crash. We have updated the link to include all publications of the staff during the last decade: https://citycollege.sheffield.eu/frontend/articles.php?cid=453&t=Publications-CSD

Also, I attach the more recent report we developed as part of a Research Exercise Framework that is done every five years.

** Q9: we believe it would be interesting to teach some French (considering that students will obtain a diploma from a French university). Do you think that is possible?

** A9: 
Yes, we intent to provide a number of French languages course for our students. 

Best wishes

Petros
