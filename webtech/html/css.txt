What is CSS?

    * CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
    * Styles define how to display HTML elements
    * Styles are normally stored in Style Sheets
    * Styles were added to HTML 4.0 to solve a problem
    * External Style Sheets can save you a lot of work
    * External Style Sheets are stored in CSS files
    * Multiple style definitions will cascade into one


Cascading Order
===============
What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?

Generally speaking we can say that all the styles will "cascade" into a new "virtual" Style Sheet by the following rules, where number four has the highest priority:

   1. Browser default
   2. External Style Sheet
   3. Internal Style Sheet (inside the <head> tag)
   4. Inline Style (inside HTML element)

===========================================================
                     SYNTAX
===========================================================
The CSS syntax is made up of three parts: a selector, a property and a value:

selector {property: value}

The selector is normally the HTML element/tag you wish to define, the property 
is the attribute you wish to change, and each property can take a value. The 
property and value are separated by a colon and surrounded by curly braces:

body {color: black}

If  the value is multiple words, put quotes around the value:

p {font-family: "sans serif"}

Note: If you wish to specify more than one property, you should separate each 
property with a semi-colon. The example below shows how to define a center aligned 
paragraph, with a red text color:

p {text-align:center;color:red}

To make the style definitions more readable, you can describe one property on each line, like this:

p
{
text-align: center;
color: black;
font-family: arial
}

Grouping
========
You can group selectors. Separate each selector with a comma. In the example 
below we have grouped all the header elements. Each header element will be 
green:

h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 
{
color: green
}

The class Selector
==================
With the class selector you can define different styles for the same type of 
HTML element. Say that you would like to have two types of paragraphs in your 
document: one right-aligned paragraph, and one center-aligned paragraph. Here 
is how you can do it with styles:

p.right {text-align: right}
p.center {text-align: center}

You have to use the class attribute in your HTML document:

<p class="right">
This paragraph will be right-aligned.
</p>

<p class="center">
This paragraph will be center-aligned.
</p>

Note: Only one class attribute can be specified per HTML element! The example below is wrong:

<p class="right" class="center">
This is a paragraph.
</p>

You can also omit the tag name in the selector to define a style that will be used by 
all HTML elements that have a certain class. In the example below, all HTML elements 
with class="center" will be center-aligned:

.center {text-align: center}

In the code below both the h1 element and the p element have class="center". This means 
that both elements will follow the rules in the ".center" selector:  

<h1 class="center">
This heading will be center-aligned
</h1>

<p class="center">
This paragraph will also be center-aligned.
</p> 


The id Selector
===============
The id selector is different from the class selector. While a class 
selector may apply to SEVERAL elements on a page, an id selector always 
applies to only ONE element.

An ID attribute must be unique within the document.

The style rule below will match a p element that has the id value "para1":

p#para1
{
text-align: center;
color: red
}

The style rule below will match the first element that has the id value "wer345":

*#wer345 {color: green}

The rule above will match this h1 element:

<h1 id="wer345">Some text</h1>

The style rule below will match a p element that has the id value "wer345":

p#wer345 {color: green}

The rule above will not match this h2 element:

<h2 id="wer345">Some text</h2>



=============================================================
                  INSERT A STYLE SHEET
=============================================================


External Style Sheet
====================
An external style sheet is ideal when the style is applied to many pages. With 
an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire Web site by 
changing one file. Each page must link to the style sheet using the <link> tag. 
The <link> tag goes inside the head section:

<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
href="mystyle.css" />
</head>

Internal Style Sheet
====================
An internal style sheet should be used when a single document has a unique style. 
You define internal styles in the head section by using the <style> tag, like this:

<head>
<style type="text/css">
hr {color: sienna}
p {margin-left: 20px}
body {background-image: url("images/back40.gif")}
</style>
</head>

Inline Styles
=============
An inline style loses many of the advantages of style sheets by mixing content with 
presentation. Use this method sparingly, such as when a style is to be applied to a 
single occurrence of an element.

To use inline styles you use the style attribute in the relevant tag. The style 
attribute can contain any CSS property. The example shows how to change the color and 
the left margin of a paragraph:

<p style="color: sienna; margin-left: 20px">
This is a paragraph
</p>
